# Linux Ubuntu container using proot with XFCE desktop when you can't use sudo / root / admin priveleges on hopefully any server

1. Install dependencies (proot)
```
wget proot
wget libtalloc.so.2
chmod a+rx proot
chmod a+rx libtalloc.so.2
```
note: proot and libtalloc is from debian 10 (buster)  
2. Pick Androinix or Termux with amd64 (or whatever you're using) distro  
3. Let's see if it works
